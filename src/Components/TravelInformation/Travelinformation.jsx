                Brazil has increasingly invested in public safety. The country
                has been strengthening security in tourist destinations so
                tourists who intend to visit the country can feel safe when
                traveling to Brazil. The Ministry of Tourism is creating the
                Safe Tourism Program, a national program that focuses on several
                fields of action to increase tourist safety. This way, visitors
                will be able to enjoy all the wonderful attractions Brazil has
                to offer. If there are any incidents, there are police stations
                all over the Brazilian territory. Most capital cities have
                specialized police stations to assist tourists. If you happen to
                be in a city where there is no specialized police station for
                tourists, you can contact any regular police station to file
                your incident report. This means more safety and attention for
                tourists who come to Brazil.
